# Learn Numbers and Letters Game

A fun and interactive game for kids to learn how to write numbers and letters. The game uses your browser's speech synthesis to announce a character, and you draw it on the canvas. An OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine then checks your drawing.

## Features

- **Intelligent OCR Checking**: Uses Tesseract.js to recognize the characters you draw.
- **Dual Modes**: Switch between learning numbers and capital letters.
- **Voice Prompts**: The game speaks the character you need to draw, with a friendly female voice.
- **Replay Sound**: A button to replay the voice prompt if you miss it.
- **Adaptive Hints**: A transparent guide of the character is shown to help you. This guide disappears after you've successfully drawn a character four times.
- **Helpful Re-Hinting**: If you get stuck on a character you've already mastered, the hint will reappear after two incorrect attempts.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: In number mode, after 4 correct answers, the game introduces numbers up to 20.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of your total score.
- **Persistent Stats**: Your scores for each character are saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so you can pick up where you left off.
- **Distraction-Free Drawing**: The canvas is locked while the game is checking your answer.
- **Fun Colors**: The drawing brush color changes to a bright, happy color with every new level.
